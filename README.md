# ProvInCiA

ProvInCiA is a framework to capture provenance in Smart Cities. Its main idea is described in our SBBD paper: 

Falci, M.; Pina, D.; Kunstmann, L.; Braganholo, V.; Oliveira, D. [Tudo em Todo Lugar ao Mesmo Tempo: Rastreabilidade de Dados em Cidades Inteligentes por meio de ProveniÃªncia](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbbd/article/view/37251). Brazilian Symposium on Databases, 2025. pp. 371--384. 

## Preliminary Experiments 

Our [SBBD paper](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbbd/article/view/37251) contains a preliminary experiment where we show the feasibility of ProvInCiA in a real case study. On the paper, please consider the link https://github.com/dew-uff/provincia/tree/main/experiments/preliminary_evaluation/queries instead of https://github.com/dew-uff/provincia/tree/main/Evaluation/sql, since data on the repository has been moved after the paper was published.
